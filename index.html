      This document provides the steps to create a VPC with a private and public
      subnet. The goal is to configure the VPC network to allow internet access
      for a Web Server deployed inside a publicly exposed subnet and a Database
      Server in a private subnet while maintaining proper security controls.

      <h4>Goal:</h4>
      Enable internet access with proper security controls to allow internet
      access while maintaining protection of the private subnet. Attach an
      Internet Gateway, update NACLs, Security Groups, and route tables. <br />
      The current configuration to fix includes a VPC with two subnets: a public
      and private subnet. The Web Server is deployed inside the public subnet
      and the database is deployed in the private subnet. <br />

    <div
      class="container"
      style="width: 70%; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 20px"
    >
      <h4>Step 1: Attach the Internet Gateway</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Search and click on Internet Gateway. Click on Create Internet
          Gateway.
        </li>
        <li>
          Name the Internet Gateway. Then click Create. However, it is not
          attached to the VPC. Must attach it.
        </li>
        <li>
          To attach Internet Gateway, click on Actions, then select Attach to
          VPC and select the VPC with name of your VPC.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div
      class="container"
      style="width: 70%; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 20px"

      <h4>
        Step 2: Set the route table for the Web Server in the public subnet
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>In the AWS console, search for EC2.</li>
        <li>Click on EC2, then click on Instances in the right side column.</li>
        <li>Click on the details of the Web Server instance.</li>
        <li>Select the Networking tab.</li>
        <li>
          Click on the Subnet ID. It will open a new table with the subnet in
          that VPC.
        </li>
        <li>
          Checkmark the box with the subnet and click on the Route table tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on the route table with the link of the name that contains the
          web server subnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit the route table and add route with Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and
          Target: Internet Gateway.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The public subnet is now reachable from the internet</p>

      <h4>
        Step 3: Add a NAT Gateway
      </h4>
      <p>
        The NAT gateway should reside in the public subnet, not the private
        subnet. Then, create a route table in the private subnet to route
        traffic to the NAT gateway. An elastic IP address is required to associate
        the private subnet with the NAT Gateway.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Navigate to your VPC, then in the left navigation pane, select Elastic
          IPs.
        </li>
        <li>Click on Allocate Elastic IP address</li>
        <li>
          Leave the default settings unless you want to change the Region. Then
          click Allocate to get the new IP.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go back to your VPC and in the left navigation pane, select NAT
          Gateways
        </li>
        <li>Click on Create NAT Gateway</li>
        <li>
          Choose the Public Subnet where you want the NAT Gateway to reside
          (note: it must have a route to the Internet Gateway)
        </li>
        <li>Associate the Elastic IP (EIP), then click Create NAT Gateway</li>
        <li>
          Go to the route table in the private subnet to point internet traffic
          to the NAT gateway -> Go to VPC, then select Route Tables in the left
          navigation pane.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the Route table in the private subnet and click Edit Routes,
          then Add Route
        </li>
        <li>Set the Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and Target: NAT Gateway.</li>
        <li>Click Save</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This configuration routes the traffic from the private subnet to the NAT
        Gateway in the public subnet, which then sends the traffic to the
        Internet Gateway. This setup allows secure internet access without
        exposing the private subnet to incoming internet traffic.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div
      class="container"
      style="width: 70%; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 50px"
    >
      <h4>Step 4: Create a Security Group</h4>
      <p>
        Security Groups are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound
        traffic at the EC2 instance level. By default, a security group denies
        all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. <br />
        Security Groups perform stateful packet filtering meaning that when an
        outbound request is made, the firewall remembers the connection such
        that when the response comes back, it is automatically allowed, even if
        there is no explicit inbound rule for it. <br />
        Security Groups can only have allow rules, and rules can be based in IP
        addresses or other Security Groups. <br />
        These steps show how to change the security group for the public subnet
        containing the web server so that it may receive web requests from the
        internet.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the left navigation pane, select Security groups.</li>
        <li>
          In the Basic details section, locate the Security group name and enter
          Web Security Group. Description: Enable HTTP access from anywhere.
          Choose the VPC you want the security group to be associated with.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a rule to the security group to allow inbound web requests from
          anywhere. For Inbound rules, select Add rule. For Type: HTTP; for
          Source: Anywhere-IPv4; Description: Allow web requests from anywhere.
          Then click Create security group.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Recall, since security groups are stateful, we only need to create
              an inbound rule instead of specifying both an inbound and outbound
              rule
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          By default, the Security group for the private subnet denies all
          inbound traffic, but you may follow the same steps if you would like
          to add other rules such as SSH access on port 22.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div
      class="container"
      style="width: 70%; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 50px"
    >
      <h4>Step 5: Create a Network Access Control List (NACL)</h4>
      <p>
        NACL (Network ACL) is a firewall that controls traffic to and from a
        subnet. It can have allow and deny rules. <br />
        The rules can only include IP addresses. <br />
        Is stateless meaning that return traffic must be explicitly allowed by
        rules. <br />
        By default, each AWS account includes a default Network ACL. By default,
        the NACL will allow all inbound and outbound traffic. You can modify the
        list by adding your own rules, such as an explicit deny rule. <br />
        To modify the NACL rules:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the left navigation pane, select Network ACLs.</li>
        <li>
          Select the default Network ACL ID associated with the subnets you wish
          to modify.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on Inbound rules and Edit inbound rules to make changes
          <ul>
            <li>
              Can edit the inbound rules to allow only traffic from HTTP on port
              80 or HTTPS on port 443, or allow SSH on port 22.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Can repeat the process with clicking on the Outbound rules and
          clicking Edit outbound rules.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Customizing NACLs provides an extra layer of security and fine-grained
        control over network traffic.
